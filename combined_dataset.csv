55,"🚨 BREAKING NEWS: Biden Accidentally Bites Baby in Chicken Costume, Calls Bill Gates to Launch Emergency Global Bird Flu Vaccine Initiative

WASHINGTON, D.C. — During a playful Halloween mix-up, President Joe Biden accidentally took a bite out of a baby dressed as a chicken at the White House Halloween event. While initially brushed off as a harmless moment, it quickly escalated when Biden, visibly alarmed, phoned longtime friend and fellow “avian safety advocate” Bill Gates to initiate an immediate global bird flu vaccine campaign.

“What if this is the beginning of the Bird Flu 2.0 we’ve all been worried about?” Biden reportedly whispered to Gates over the phone, casting glances at the costume-clad child as if it might hatch a biohazardous egg at any moment.

Gates, unfazed and ready for action, sprang into high gear, announcing a “Worldwide Bird Immunization Project” to protect against any “avian-adjacent pathogens.” He then called on scientists from around the world to expedite a universal vaccine for all birds—and anyone dressed as birds—by early next week. “We’re not just protecting poultry,” Gates clarified. “We’re protecting the future.”

In a hastily organized press conference, Biden stood beside Gates, warning Americans about the “very real possibility” of a chicken-baby contagion and the urgent need for preventative measures. “Look, folks, if biting one tiny chicken baby can make me feel this way, imagine what an entire flock could do,” Biden declared. “We can’t wait for these ‘chickens’ to come home to roost.”

Gates nodded solemnly and announced he would be diverting billions into bird flu research, stating, “Whether it’s a farm chicken, a wild duck, or a child in a chicken costume, we need to be prepared.”

The pair then unveiled their joint plan: a global, mandatory bird flu vaccine rollout, prioritizing costumes at every trick-or-treating event in 2025. Biden assured the public, “Together, with Bill, we can make sure the world is safe from future poultry pandemics—real or imaginary.”",https://x.com/mdtlion/status/1852132550657085936,tweet,mdtlion,@mdtlion,"Melbourne, Australia",,,2,0,0,0,77,0,2024-10-31 16:36:25,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbQYvBGbsAAV3-f.jpg,,TwiBot-undefined-20241101_032541.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

305,"It's hard to believe the ignorance and fear that surrounds vaccinations/vaccines.  It’s 2024, and people are heading back towards the Dark Ages, in terms of their thinking.  We’ve all been vaccinated since we were kids, for school.  20+ years ago, I started getting flu shots every year--after being so sick for two years in a row, and I’ve been getting them ever since.  I’ve also gotten all the required COVID vaccinations, and every booster since we began.  The only reason I wouldn’t get properly vaccinated?  And, for those who are still on the outdated bandwagon, saying vaccines cause Autism in children, Andrew Wakefield’s studies were completely flawed and scientifically debunked.  Of course, if you feel the need to bypass vaccinations, you could always try injecting a little bleach🙄

So that article was already being very disingenuous as a mild case of covid is the same as a mild case of the flu and a severe case of the flu, if not treated is equally as deadly as COVID. 

The only argument you might have had was prior to vaccines being a thing, and even then, natural immunity would have taken effect had we made sure to protect those most vulnerable to the disease, let us say, people 70 or older and people who are immuno-compromised.

694,"🚨 H5N1 avian flu isolate from dairy worker is transmissible, lethal in animals

https://t.co/owowQHJPEq

October 28, 2024
In experiments designed to learn more about the threat from the H5N1 avian flu virus spreading from cows to people, researchers found that an isolate from a sick dairy worker may be capable of replicating in human airway cells, is pathogenic in mice and ferrets, and can transmit among ferrets by respiratory droplets.

The team, based at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Japan, reported its findings today in Nature. Working in a high-containment lab, the researchers used an H5N1 isolate grown from the eye of a dairy worker who had experienced conjunctivitis after exposure to infected cows.

They found that the virus has a PB2-E627K mutation that has been seen in H5N1 viruses that replicate in mammals.

In their multipart investigation, they found that the virus was sensitive to most antivirals, including favipiravir, baloxavir marboxil, and zanamivir, but was less sensitive to oseltamivir, according to a press release from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which funded much of the work.

Tests using human cornea and lung cells found that the virus was able to replicate. And, in mouse tissue experiments, the scientists found that the H5N1 virus was able to infect 15 different tissues, with the highest levels seen in respiratory tissues.

Lethal pattern in ferrets
Meanwhile, the team infected ferrets with a high dose of the virus from the dairy worker, and the infection pattern was more similar to human infections than mice infections. Ferrets are known as one of the best animal models for influenza in humans, because clinical signs of disease and transmission are similar.

All ferrets died within 5 days, and tissue sampling found the virus in all types, with the highest levels in the animals' respiratory tissues. In contrast, earlier research using a bovine H5N1 virus to infect ferrets found that the infections were severe, but not as lethal.

To gauge respiratory transmission, the team placed healthy ferrets in cages next to ferrets that were infected with different doses of the virus from the dairy worker. From 17% to 33% of ferrets in adjacent cages were infected by respiratory droplets, suggesting that the virus from humans can spread among mammals by that route, but with limited efficiency. All directly infected ferrets died within 6 days.

""Based in these observations, every effort should be made to contain HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle to limit the possibility of further human infections,"" they wrote.

California reports another suspected case

California today reported another suspected human H5N1 infection, which if confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would raise the state's total 16.

The CDC on October 25 confirmed 3 more infections in Washington poultry cullers, bringing the national total to 34. Once the California infection is confirmed by the CDC, the national total would rise to 35.

Virus strikes more cows, poultry
Meanwhile, the surge in outbreaks continues in California dairy cattle. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 41 more outbreaks, raising the state's total to 178 and the national total to 380 from 14 states.

Also, APHIS confirmed more outbreaks in poultry in the West, this time in Oregon, including an egg-laying farm in Clackamas County that has 146,000 birds and a backyard facility in Crook County.

The agency also confirmed an outbreak at another broiler farm in Tulare County, California, and another in backyard poultry in Washington.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1851174728473403691,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,1,0,0,0,54,0,2024-10-29 01:10:23,,,TwiBot-undefined-20241101_033929.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

793,"🚨 H5N1 avian flu isolate from dairy worker is transmissible, lethal in animals

https://t.co/owowQHJPEq

October 28, 2024
In experiments designed to learn more about the threat from the H5N1 avian flu virus spreading from cows to people, researchers found that an isolate from a sick dairy worker may be capable of replicating in human airway cells, is pathogenic in mice and ferrets, and can transmit among ferrets by respiratory droplets.

The team, based at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Japan, reported its findings today in Nature. Working in a high-containment lab, the researchers used an H5N1 isolate grown from the eye of a dairy worker who had experienced conjunctivitis after exposure to infected cows.

They found that the virus has a PB2-E627K mutation that has been seen in H5N1 viruses that replicate in mammals.

In their multipart investigation, they found that the virus was sensitive to most antivirals, including favipiravir, baloxavir marboxil, and zanamivir, but was less sensitive to oseltamivir, according to a press release from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which funded much of the work.

Tests using human cornea and lung cells found that the virus was able to replicate. And, in mouse tissue experiments, the scientists found that the H5N1 virus was able to infect 15 different tissues, with the highest levels seen in respiratory tissues.

Lethal pattern in ferrets
Meanwhile, the team infected ferrets with a high dose of the virus from the dairy worker, and the infection pattern was more similar to human infections than mice infections. Ferrets are known as one of the best animal models for influenza in humans, because clinical signs of disease and transmission are similar.

All ferrets died within 5 days, and tissue sampling found the virus in all types, with the highest levels in the animals' respiratory tissues. In contrast, earlier research using a bovine H5N1 virus to infect ferrets found that the infections were severe, but not as lethal.

To gauge respiratory transmission, the team placed healthy ferrets in cages next to ferrets that were infected with different doses of the virus from the dairy worker. From 17% to 33% of ferrets in adjacent cages were infected by respiratory droplets, suggesting that the virus from humans can spread among mammals by that route, but with limited efficiency. All directly infected ferrets died within 6 days.

""Based in these observations, every effort should be made to contain HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle to limit the possibility of further human infections,"" they wrote.

California reports another suspected case

California today reported another suspected human H5N1 infection, which if confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would raise the state's total 16.

The CDC on October 25 confirmed 3 more infections in Washington poultry cullers, bringing the national total to 34. Once the California infection is confirmed by the CDC, the national total would rise to 35.

Virus strikes more cows, poultry
Meanwhile, the surge in outbreaks continues in California dairy cattle. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 41 more outbreaks, raising the state's total to 178 and the national total to 380 from 14 states.

Also, APHIS confirmed more outbreaks in poultry in the West, this time in Oregon, including an egg-laying farm in Clackamas County that has 146,000 birds and a backyard facility in Crook County.

The agency also confirmed an outbreak at another broiler farm in Tulare County, California, and another in backyard poultry in Washington.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1851174728473403691,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,1,0,0,0,54,0,2024-10-29 01:10:23,,,TwiBot-undefined-20241101_033759.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

1007,"🚨 BREAKING NEWS: Biden Accidentally Bites Baby in Chicken Costume, Calls Bill Gates to Launch Emergency Global Bird Flu Vaccine Initiative

WASHINGTON, D.C. — During a playful Halloween mix-up, President Joe Biden accidentally took a bite out of a baby dressed as a chicken at the White House Halloween event. While initially brushed off as a harmless moment, it quickly escalated when Biden, visibly alarmed, phoned longtime friend and fellow “avian safety advocate” Bill Gates to initiate an immediate global bird flu vaccine campaign.

“What if this is the beginning of the Bird Flu 2.0 we’ve all been worried about?” Biden reportedly whispered to Gates over the phone, casting glances at the costume-clad child as if it might hatch a biohazardous egg at any moment.

Gates, unfazed and ready for action, sprang into high gear, announcing a “Worldwide Bird Immunization Project” to protect against any “avian-adjacent pathogens.” He then called on scientists from around the world to expedite a universal vaccine for all birds—and anyone dressed as birds—by early next week. “We’re not just protecting poultry,” Gates clarified. “We’re protecting the future.”

In a hastily organized press conference, Biden stood beside Gates, warning Americans about the “very real possibility” of a chicken-baby contagion and the urgent need for preventative measures. “Look, folks, if biting one tiny chicken baby can make me feel this way, imagine what an entire flock could do,” Biden declared. “We can’t wait for these ‘chickens’ to come home to roost.”

Gates nodded solemnly and announced he would be diverting billions into bird flu research, stating, “Whether it’s a farm chicken, a wild duck, or a child in a chicken costume, we need to be prepared.”

The pair then unveiled their joint plan: a global, mandatory bird flu vaccine rollout, prioritizing costumes at every trick-or-treating event in 2025. Biden assured the public, “Together, with Bill, we can make sure the world is safe from future poultry pandemics—real or imaginary.”",https://x.com/mdtlion/status/1852132550657085936,tweet,mdtlion,@mdtlion,"Melbourne, Australia",,,2,0,0,0,77,0,2024-10-31 16:36:25,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbQYvBGbsAAV3-f.jpg,,TwiBot-undefined-20241101_031523.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

1038,"I previously worked in the emergency department at a local hospital that mandated the flu vaccine (this was prior to covid so I imagine they have also put this in place for that too). They did not allow for philosophical exemption, however, a religious exemption could be obtained.
I compiled my letter of exemption request after researching and reviewing information that others had posted online who were successful with receiving an exemption in the healthcare field. Back in 2013, when I compiled this, there weren't very many of us trying to do this, and it was difficult to find anyone posting about this online (yes, I've been a ""rebel"" for a long time lol). Fast forward to today, and I know there are many people who may be in a similar situation now and not wanting to be forced to take a vaccine as a condition of employment. I am sharing my letter that I submitted to my employer  for anyone to read and use for information or inspiration if you are in a situation where your employer is mandating you to be vaccinated.

Please share with anyone who may find this helpful! Obviously at this point any letters of this nature would need to be revised to include information regarding covid vaccines as well.

https://t.co/aZ1kI8w6II

A week after Washington reported human cases of bird flu in the state, officials have announced that three of those cases had traveled to Oregon during their infection and were monitored during their stay.

All three cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were reported in Washington after they were exposed to poultry that tested positive for the virus on Oct. 15. As of Thursday, Oct. 31, there have been nine total cases in Washington — including those who had traveled to Oregon.

Oregon Health Authority officials say the cases have returned to Washington and will continue to be monitored by Washington health staff until 10 days following their last exposure.

“At this time, the risk for the general public remains low,” Dr. Melissa Sutton with Oregon Public Health said in a statement. “People who have had close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals, or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at increased risk of infection.”

Washington Department of Health announced another bird flu case that led to 800,000 euthanized birds in Franklin County after they all tested positive on Oct. 15. Another case was recorded at a Clackamas County commercial poultry farm, and those birds were also euthanized to limit the spread of the disease.

It is not clear which Clackamas County poultry facility was impacted in this case, but the ODA said the operation consisted of 150,000 birds.

So far, there have been no human cases of HPAI that originated in Oregon.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1852294891801313335,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,0,0,0,0,3,0,2024-11-01 03:21:30,,,TwiBot-undefined-20241101_033628.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

1610,"🚨Alberta COVID Update Oct 31, 2024
COVID Deaths
4 reported - 22 added, 119 total.
Only 1 Flu, 0 RSV all season.

KP.2 shots
161,881 given (314,488 total).

'Outbreaks'
45 new outbreaks (~200 active).

89.3% of all COVID shots given by Pharmacies under direct contract to the Alberta Government - FOR PROFIT

91% of all 'outbreaks' in the last week were listed as 'COVID' based on known flawed RPP and RAT tests.
Each 'positive' test isolates a resident/patient for 5 days (Care Home)/10 days (Hospital) AND extends isolation protocols for the whole unit/floor for an additional 15 days.

Patients/Residents are also being moved post-isolation into rooms with other 'positive' residents/patients and flagged as 'Close Contacts'. They are then placed again on COVID isolation protocols for a further 10 days.
TESTED AND ISOLATED TO DEATH.

The AGM vote won't change anything.
All the people who are really 'CHOOSING"" your UCP leader this weekend support the perception of ""CHOICE"". Just not your expectation of choice.
There is no Informed Consent while the government lies and those around them help with the cover-up.
This isn't CHOICE. THIS IS GENOCIDE.
Rights are irrelevant when the government lies about data to mislead the public about safety, efficacy & need.
Over 50% of infants have had COVID shots in Alberta. 
In less than 2 weeks, Albertans took 307,984 KP.2 COVID shots = 36% of all XBB shots given in the previous year.

Death by design.
Deadly lockdowns never ended. They became extended and more restrictive 'outbreaks' - targeting those most in need of protection. Hospitals, Long Term Care Homes, and Supportive Living (Retirement Homes) - none are 'safe' and it is all under the lie of 'Focused Protection' cheered on by almost all in the freedom movement.
Rights are irrelevant when the government directs hospitals & care homes to increase deadly restrictions for ANY illness. 
COVID isn't treated like flu. Everything from a cold to diarrhea has a 'COVID' response. 303 lockdowns behind closed doors in Alberta since Aug 24, 2024.

If you vote at the UCP AGM, remember no one pushing politics as an answer plans for the insanity to end. Cash cow lawsuits, designed to fail. Legislation that makes things worse (Sovereignty Act, Bill of Rights). None want accountability, because they are also accountable.

2111,"It is an established and acknowledged fact that the shots made most people ill soon after they took them. The clinical trials show this. At least 80% of people in the Moderna clinical trial experienced one or more of these symptoms: headache, fever, chills, joint pain, nausea/vomiting, muscle pain. I bet the vast majority of people know at least one person who became quite ill after the vaccine for 3 or more days.

Most people were willing to accept some illness only because they believed the so-called vaccines would prevent them from getting covid and because they were told that illness meant the shots were working. Of course, when the shots failed, the calculus changed. Why suffer through a post-vaccine illness only to then become sick with the virus anyway?  It's common sense not to do this.

I am very curious about why people are still taking boosters, so I often read the comments on New York Times articles about covid boosters. My impression is that people who are still taking the boosters generally fall into two camps. One group has not had post-vaccine illness. They are lucky and also in the minority. The other group is people who are still taking boosters even though past shots have made them sick because they are afraid of covid and/or are following doctor's advice. This group makes me so sad. What a terrible thing to live in this state of fear and cycle of self-harm!

Personally, if I took a pharmaceutical and suffered through illness after because I was led to believe that it would protect me from a virus and then it didn't even work, I'D BE PISSED!

is not just a tasty naturla treat, it also is anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial! Heres a few things honeysuckle can achieve...

-Treating Infections: Honeysuckle is often used to help treat respiratory infections like colds, flu, and sore throats due to its ability to fight bacteria and viruses.
-Reducing Inflammation: It's used to reduce swelling and heat in the body, which can help with conditions like fever or skin inflammations.
-Detoxification: In TCM, honeysuckle is considered to have detoxifying properties, helping to clear heat and toxins from the body, which is believed to aid in the treatment of boils, sores, and other skin conditions.

2394,"🚨 H5N1 avian flu isolate from dairy worker is transmissible, lethal in animals

https://t.co/owowQHJPEq

October 28, 2024
In experiments designed to learn more about the threat from the H5N1 avian flu virus spreading from cows to people, researchers found that an isolate from a sick dairy worker may be capable of replicating in human airway cells, is pathogenic in mice and ferrets, and can transmit among ferrets by respiratory droplets.

The team, based at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Japan, reported its findings today in Nature. Working in a high-containment lab, the researchers used an H5N1 isolate grown from the eye of a dairy worker who had experienced conjunctivitis after exposure to infected cows.

They found that the virus has a PB2-E627K mutation that has been seen in H5N1 viruses that replicate in mammals.

In their multipart investigation, they found that the virus was sensitive to most antivirals, including favipiravir, baloxavir marboxil, and zanamivir, but was less sensitive to oseltamivir, according to a press release from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which funded much of the work.

Tests using human cornea and lung cells found that the virus was able to replicate. And, in mouse tissue experiments, the scientists found that the H5N1 virus was able to infect 15 different tissues, with the highest levels seen in respiratory tissues.

Lethal pattern in ferrets
Meanwhile, the team infected ferrets with a high dose of the virus from the dairy worker, and the infection pattern was more similar to human infections than mice infections. Ferrets are known as one of the best animal models for influenza in humans, because clinical signs of disease and transmission are similar.

All ferrets died within 5 days, and tissue sampling found the virus in all types, with the highest levels in the animals' respiratory tissues. In contrast, earlier research using a bovine H5N1 virus to infect ferrets found that the infections were severe, but not as lethal.

To gauge respiratory transmission, the team placed healthy ferrets in cages next to ferrets that were infected with different doses of the virus from the dairy worker. From 17% to 33% of ferrets in adjacent cages were infected by respiratory droplets, suggesting that the virus from humans can spread among mammals by that route, but with limited efficiency. All directly infected ferrets died within 6 days.

""Based in these observations, every effort should be made to contain HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle to limit the possibility of further human infections,"" they wrote.

California reports another suspected case

California today reported another suspected human H5N1 infection, which if confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would raise the state's total 16.

The CDC on October 25 confirmed 3 more infections in Washington poultry cullers, bringing the national total to 34. Once the California infection is confirmed by the CDC, the national total would rise to 35.

Virus strikes more cows, poultry
Meanwhile, the surge in outbreaks continues in California dairy cattle. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 41 more outbreaks, raising the state's total to 178 and the national total to 380 from 14 states.

Also, APHIS confirmed more outbreaks in poultry in the West, this time in Oregon, including an egg-laying farm in Clackamas County that has 146,000 birds and a backyard facility in Crook County.

The agency also confirmed an outbreak at another broiler farm in Tulare County, California, and another in backyard poultry in Washington.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1851174728473403691,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,1,0,0,0,54,0,2024-10-29 01:10:23,,,TwiBot-flu_spreading-20241101_034102.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

2602,"Here are some natural remedies for common ailments that can provide relief while supporting overall well-being:

1. Cold and Flu

•Honey and Lemon: Mix honey with warm water and lemon juice to soothe sore throats and ease coughs. Honey has antimicrobial properties, while lemon provides a boost of vitamin C.
•Ginger Tea: Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can help alleviate congestion and sore throats. Add fresh ginger to hot water with a bit of honey.

2. Headaches

•Peppermint Oil: Applying diluted peppermint oil to the temples can provide relief due to its cooling effect, which may ease tension.
•Lavender Oil: Inhaling lavender oil or using it in a diffuser can help reduce stress and may alleviate headache symptoms.

3. Digestive Issues

•Ginger: Chewing a piece of ginger or drinking ginger tea can relieve nausea and stomach upset.
•Peppermint: Peppermint tea or oil can help soothe digestive discomfort, including bloating and gas.

4. Insomnia

•Chamomile Tea: Known for its calming effects, chamomile tea before bed can help promote relaxation and better sleep.
•Lavender Essential Oil: A few drops on your pillow or in a diffuser can create a calming atmosphere conducive to sleep.

5. Muscle Pain

•Epsom Salt Bath: Adding Epsom salt to a warm bath can help relax muscles and reduce inflammation due to its magnesium content.
•Turmeric: Turmeric’s anti-inflammatory properties make it beneficial for muscle soreness. Drinking golden milk (turmeric with warm milk) may aid in muscle recovery.

6. Stress and Anxiety

•Ashwagandha: This adaptogenic herb is known to help reduce stress by balancing cortisol levels. Ashwagandha supplements or tea can be calming.
•Deep Breathing and Meditation: Practicing mindful breathing exercises can help calm the mind and reduce anxiety naturally.

7. Skin Irritations

•Aloe Vera: Applying fresh aloe vera gel can soothe sunburns and other skin irritations due to its cooling and anti-inflammatory properties.
•Oatmeal Bath: Colloidal oatmeal in a warm bath can help relieve itchy skin caused by eczema or other irritants.

8. Allergies

•Local Honey: Consuming small amounts of local honey is thought to help the body build immunity to local pollen, which may reduce allergy symptoms over time.
•Nasal Rinse with Saline: A saline solution can help clear allergens from nasal passages and reduce congestion.

Using these remedies mindfully can support overall health and alleviate mild symptoms.

So that article was already being very disingenuous as a mild case of covid is the same as a mild case of the flu and a severe case of the flu, if not treated is equally as deadly as COVID. 

The only argument you might have had was prior to vaccines being a thing, and even then, natural immunity would have taken effect had we made sure to protect those most vulnerable to the disease, let us say, people 70 or older and people who are immuno-compromised.

The 99.8% survivability. I even said that they wanted to kill us, it's depopulation and understood it in a movie-like sense.

Yet, I didn't understand that they were REALLY killing people, and even MY local medical personnel were going along with it. I mean, there were no carts of dead people. I didn't see multiple funeral processions. No spike in obits in the newspaper (not that I looked at newspapers too often).

I don't think I really believed any of it. Until they killed my husband. I don't even know if I'm making sense here. Because I didn't think any of it was REALLY, REALLY real, I blame myself for allowing them to kill him.

https://t.co/aZ1kI8w6II

A week after Washington reported human cases of bird flu in the state, officials have announced that three of those cases had traveled to Oregon during their infection and were monitored during their stay.

All three cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were reported in Washington after they were exposed to poultry that tested positive for the virus on Oct. 15. As of Thursday, Oct. 31, there have been nine total cases in Washington — including those who had traveled to Oregon.

Oregon Health Authority officials say the cases have returned to Washington and will continue to be monitored by Washington health staff until 10 days following their last exposure.

“At this time, the risk for the general public remains low,” Dr. Melissa Sutton with Oregon Public Health said in a statement. “People who have had close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals, or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at increased risk of infection.”

Washington Department of Health announced another bird flu case that led to 800,000 euthanized birds in Franklin County after they all tested positive on Oct. 15. Another case was recorded at a Clackamas County commercial poultry farm, and those birds were also euthanized to limit the spread of the disease.

It is not clear which Clackamas County poultry facility was impacted in this case, but the ODA said the operation consisted of 150,000 birds.

So far, there have been no human cases of HPAI that originated in Oregon.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1852294891801313335,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,0,0,0,0,-,0,2024-11-01 03:21:30,,,TwiBot-Flu-20241101_032406.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

The ER is only for life or limb threatening issues like sudden chest pain, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, trauma, compound fractures, severe abdominal pain, or the worst headache of your life, etc. 

Urgent Care is for colds/flu (although staying home is even better), rashes with a fever (over 101), breaks/sprains, uncontrolled vomiting/diarrhea, UTIs, stitches, vaginal bleeding, minor car accidents, etc. Things you can’t wait a week to be addressed but won’t kill you right now. 

Your PCP is for back pain, chronic issues, pregnancy tests, prescription refills, ingrown toenails, abscesses, rashes, STDs, vaginal discharge, chronic cough, disability, diagnosing symptoms, etc. 

The ER is not for work notes, pregnancy tests, tooth pain, hangovers, fevers under 103, or medication refills. 

Calling an ambulance will not get you seen any faster in the ER  nor will complaining about the wait. If you’re well enough to complain, you probably shouldn’t be in an ER. 

Don’t be THAT patient that makes us roll our eyes and clogs up the ER.

3211,"It is an established and acknowledged fact that the shots made most people ill soon after they took them. The clinical trials show this. At least 80% of people in the Moderna clinical trial experienced one or more of these symptoms: headache, fever, chills, joint pain, nausea/vomiting, muscle pain. I bet the vast majority of people know at least one person who became quite ill after the vaccine for 3 or more days.

Most people were willing to accept some illness only because they believed the so-called vaccines would prevent them from getting covid and because they were told that illness meant the shots were working. Of course, when the shots failed, the calculus changed. Why suffer through a post-vaccine illness only to then become sick with the virus anyway?  It's common sense not to do this.

I am very curious about why people are still taking boosters, so I often read the comments on New York Times articles about covid boosters. My impression is that people who are still taking the boosters generally fall into two camps. One group has not had post-vaccine illness. They are lucky and also in the minority. The other group is people who are still taking boosters even though past shots have made them sick because they are afraid of covid and/or are following doctor's advice. This group makes me so sad. What a terrible thing to live in this state of fear and cycle of self-harm!

Personally, if I took a pharmaceutical and suffered through illness after because I was led to believe that it would protect me from a virus and then it didn't even work, I'D BE PISSED!

3355,"🚨 BREAKING NEWS: Biden Accidentally Bites Baby in Chicken Costume, Calls Bill Gates to Launch Emergency Global Bird Flu Vaccine Initiative

WASHINGTON, D.C. — During a playful Halloween mix-up, President Joe Biden accidentally took a bite out of a baby dressed as a chicken at the White House Halloween event. While initially brushed off as a harmless moment, it quickly escalated when Biden, visibly alarmed, phoned longtime friend and fellow “avian safety advocate” Bill Gates to initiate an immediate global bird flu vaccine campaign.

“What if this is the beginning of the Bird Flu 2.0 we’ve all been worried about?” Biden reportedly whispered to Gates over the phone, casting glances at the costume-clad child as if it might hatch a biohazardous egg at any moment.

Gates, unfazed and ready for action, sprang into high gear, announcing a “Worldwide Bird Immunization Project” to protect against any “avian-adjacent pathogens.” He then called on scientists from around the world to expedite a universal vaccine for all birds—and anyone dressed as birds—by early next week. “We’re not just protecting poultry,” Gates clarified. “We’re protecting the future.”

In a hastily organized press conference, Biden stood beside Gates, warning Americans about the “very real possibility” of a chicken-baby contagion and the urgent need for preventative measures. “Look, folks, if biting one tiny chicken baby can make me feel this way, imagine what an entire flock could do,” Biden declared. “We can’t wait for these ‘chickens’ to come home to roost.”

Gates nodded solemnly and announced he would be diverting billions into bird flu research, stating, “Whether it’s a farm chicken, a wild duck, or a child in a chicken costume, we need to be prepared.”

The pair then unveiled their joint plan: a global, mandatory bird flu vaccine rollout, prioritizing costumes at every trick-or-treating event in 2025. Biden assured the public, “Together, with Bill, we can make sure the world is safe from future poultry pandemics—real or imaginary.”",https://x.com/mdtlion/status/1852132550657085936,tweet,mdtlion,@mdtlion,"Melbourne, Australia",,,2,0,0,0,77,0,2024-10-31 16:36:25,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbQYvBGbsAAV3-f.jpg,,combined_dataset.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

3994,"🚨 H5N1 avian flu isolate from dairy worker is transmissible, lethal in animals

https://t.co/owowQHJPEq

October 28, 2024
In experiments designed to learn more about the threat from the H5N1 avian flu virus spreading from cows to people, researchers found that an isolate from a sick dairy worker may be capable of replicating in human airway cells, is pathogenic in mice and ferrets, and can transmit among ferrets by respiratory droplets.

The team, based at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Japan, reported its findings today in Nature. Working in a high-containment lab, the researchers used an H5N1 isolate grown from the eye of a dairy worker who had experienced conjunctivitis after exposure to infected cows.

They found that the virus has a PB2-E627K mutation that has been seen in H5N1 viruses that replicate in mammals.

In their multipart investigation, they found that the virus was sensitive to most antivirals, including favipiravir, baloxavir marboxil, and zanamivir, but was less sensitive to oseltamivir, according to a press release from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which funded much of the work.

Tests using human cornea and lung cells found that the virus was able to replicate. And, in mouse tissue experiments, the scientists found that the H5N1 virus was able to infect 15 different tissues, with the highest levels seen in respiratory tissues.

Lethal pattern in ferrets
Meanwhile, the team infected ferrets with a high dose of the virus from the dairy worker, and the infection pattern was more similar to human infections than mice infections. Ferrets are known as one of the best animal models for influenza in humans, because clinical signs of disease and transmission are similar.

All ferrets died within 5 days, and tissue sampling found the virus in all types, with the highest levels in the animals' respiratory tissues. In contrast, earlier research using a bovine H5N1 virus to infect ferrets found that the infections were severe, but not as lethal.

To gauge respiratory transmission, the team placed healthy ferrets in cages next to ferrets that were infected with different doses of the virus from the dairy worker. From 17% to 33% of ferrets in adjacent cages were infected by respiratory droplets, suggesting that the virus from humans can spread among mammals by that route, but with limited efficiency. All directly infected ferrets died within 6 days.

""Based in these observations, every effort should be made to contain HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle to limit the possibility of further human infections,"" they wrote.

California reports another suspected case

California today reported another suspected human H5N1 infection, which if confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would raise the state's total 16.

The CDC on October 25 confirmed 3 more infections in Washington poultry cullers, bringing the national total to 34. Once the California infection is confirmed by the CDC, the national total would rise to 35.

Virus strikes more cows, poultry
Meanwhile, the surge in outbreaks continues in California dairy cattle. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 41 more outbreaks, raising the state's total to 178 and the national total to 380 from 14 states.

Also, APHIS confirmed more outbreaks in poultry in the West, this time in Oregon, including an egg-laying farm in Clackamas County that has 146,000 birds and a backyard facility in Crook County.

The agency also confirmed an outbreak at another broiler farm in Tulare County, California, and another in backyard poultry in Washington.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1851174728473403691,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,1,0,0,0,54,0,2024-10-29 01:10:23,,,combined_dataset.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

In experiments designed to learn more about the threat from the H5N1 avian flu virus spreading from cows to people, researchers found that an isolate from a sick dairy worker may be capable of replicating in human airway cells, is pathogenic in mice and ferrets, and can transmit among ferrets by respiratory droplets.

The team, based at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Japan, reported its findings today in Nature. Working in a high-containment lab, the researchers used an H5N1 isolate grown from the eye of a dairy worker who had experienced conjunctivitis after exposure to infected cows.

They found that the virus has a PB2-E627K mutation that has been seen in H5N1 viruses that replicate in mammals.

In their multipart investigation, they found that the virus was sensitive to most antivirals, including favipiravir, baloxavir marboxil, and zanamivir, but was less sensitive to oseltamivir, according to a press release from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which funded much of the work.

Tests using human cornea and lung cells found that the virus was able to replicate. And, in mouse tissue experiments, the scientists found that the H5N1 virus was able to infect 15 different tissues, with the highest levels seen in respiratory tissues.

Lethal pattern in ferrets
Meanwhile, the team infected ferrets with a high dose of the virus from the dairy worker, and the infection pattern was more similar to human infections than mice infections. Ferrets are known as one of the best animal models for influenza in humans, because clinical signs of disease and transmission are similar.

All ferrets died within 5 days, and tissue sampling found the virus in all types, with the highest levels in the animals' respiratory tissues. In contrast, earlier research using a bovine H5N1 virus to infect ferrets found that the infections were severe, but not as lethal.

To gauge respiratory transmission, the team placed healthy ferrets in cages next to ferrets that were infected with different doses of the virus from the dairy worker. From 17% to 33% of ferrets in adjacent cages were infected by respiratory droplets, suggesting that the virus from humans can spread among mammals by that route, but with limited efficiency. All directly infected ferrets died within 6 days.

""Based in these observations, every effort should be made to contain HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle to limit the possibility of further human infections,"" they wrote.

California reports another suspected case

California today reported another suspected human H5N1 infection, which if confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would raise the state's total 16.

The CDC on October 25 confirmed 3 more infections in Washington poultry cullers, bringing the national total to 34. Once the California infection is confirmed by the CDC, the national total would rise to 35.

Virus strikes more cows, poultry
Meanwhile, the surge in outbreaks continues in California dairy cattle. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 41 more outbreaks, raising the state's total to 178 and the national total to 380 from 14 states.

Also, APHIS confirmed more outbreaks in poultry in the West, this time in Oregon, including an egg-laying farm in Clackamas County that has 146,000 birds and a backyard facility in Crook County.

The agency also confirmed an outbreak at another broiler farm in Tulare County, California, and another in backyard poultry in Washington.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1851174728473403691,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,1,0,0,0,54,0,2024-10-29 01:10:23,,,combined_dataset.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

4307,"🚨 BREAKING NEWS: Biden Accidentally Bites Baby in Chicken Costume, Calls Bill Gates to Launch Emergency Global Bird Flu Vaccine Initiative

WASHINGTON, D.C. — During a playful Halloween mix-up, President Joe Biden accidentally took a bite out of a baby dressed as a chicken at the White House Halloween event. While initially brushed off as a harmless moment, it quickly escalated when Biden, visibly alarmed, phoned longtime friend and fellow “avian safety advocate” Bill Gates to initiate an immediate global bird flu vaccine campaign.

“What if this is the beginning of the Bird Flu 2.0 we’ve all been worried about?” Biden reportedly whispered to Gates over the phone, casting glances at the costume-clad child as if it might hatch a biohazardous egg at any moment.

Gates, unfazed and ready for action, sprang into high gear, announcing a “Worldwide Bird Immunization Project” to protect against any “avian-adjacent pathogens.” He then called on scientists from around the world to expedite a universal vaccine for all birds—and anyone dressed as birds—by early next week. “We’re not just protecting poultry,” Gates clarified. “We’re protecting the future.”

In a hastily organized press conference, Biden stood beside Gates, warning Americans about the “very real possibility” of a chicken-baby contagion and the urgent need for preventative measures. “Look, folks, if biting one tiny chicken baby can make me feel this way, imagine what an entire flock could do,” Biden declared. “We can’t wait for these ‘chickens’ to come home to roost.”

Gates nodded solemnly and announced he would be diverting billions into bird flu research, stating, “Whether it’s a farm chicken, a wild duck, or a child in a chicken costume, we need to be prepared.”

The pair then unveiled their joint plan: a global, mandatory bird flu vaccine rollout, prioritizing costumes at every trick-or-treating event in 2025. Biden assured the public, “Together, with Bill, we can make sure the world is safe from future poultry pandemics—real or imaginary.”",https://x.com/mdtlion/status/1852132550657085936,tweet,mdtlion,@mdtlion,"Melbourne, Australia",,,2,0,0,0,77,0,2024-10-31 16:36:25,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbQYvBGbsAAV3-f.jpg,,combined_dataset.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

I compiled my letter of exemption request after researching and reviewing information that others had posted online who were successful with receiving an exemption in the healthcare field. Back in 2013, when I compiled this, there weren't very many of us trying to do this, and it was difficult to find anyone posting about this online (yes, I've been a ""rebel"" for a long time lol). Fast forward to today, and I know there are many people who may be in a similar situation now and not wanting to be forced to take a vaccine as a condition of employment. I am sharing my letter that I submitted to my employer  for anyone to read and use for information or inspiration if you are in a situation where your employer is mandating you to be vaccinated.

https://t.co/aZ1kI8w6II

A week after Washington reported human cases of bird flu in the state, officials have announced that three of those cases had traveled to Oregon during their infection and were monitored during their stay.

All three cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were reported in Washington after they were exposed to poultry that tested positive for the virus on Oct. 15. As of Thursday, Oct. 31, there have been nine total cases in Washington — including those who had traveled to Oregon.

Oregon Health Authority officials say the cases have returned to Washington and will continue to be monitored by Washington health staff until 10 days following their last exposure.

“At this time, the risk for the general public remains low,” Dr. Melissa Sutton with Oregon Public Health said in a statement. “People who have had close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals, or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at increased risk of infection.”

Washington Department of Health announced another bird flu case that led to 800,000 euthanized birds in Franklin County after they all tested positive on Oct. 15. Another case was recorded at a Clackamas County commercial poultry farm, and those birds were also euthanized to limit the spread of the disease.

It is not clear which Clackamas County poultry facility was impacted in this case, but the ODA said the operation consisted of 150,000 birds.

So far, there have been no human cases of HPAI that originated in Oregon.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1852294891801313335,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,0,0,0,0,3,0,2024-11-01 03:21:30,,,combined_dataset.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

COVID Deaths
4 reported - 22 added, 119 total.
Only 1 Flu, 0 RSV all season.

KP.2 shots
161,881 given (314,488 total).

'Outbreaks'
45 new outbreaks (~200 active).

89.3% of all COVID shots given by Pharmacies under direct contract to the Alberta Government - FOR PROFIT

91% of all 'outbreaks' in the last week were listed as 'COVID' based on known flawed RPP and RAT tests.
Each 'positive' test isolates a resident/patient for 5 days (Care Home)/10 days (Hospital) AND extends isolation protocols for the whole unit/floor for an additional 15 days.

Patients/Residents are also being moved post-isolation into rooms with other 'positive' residents/patients and flagged as 'Close Contacts'. They are then placed again on COVID isolation protocols for a further 10 days.
TESTED AND ISOLATED TO DEATH.

The AGM vote won't change anything.
All the people who are really 'CHOOSING"" your UCP leader this weekend support the perception of ""CHOICE"". Just not your expectation of choice.
There is no Informed Consent while the government lies and those around them help with the cover-up.
This isn't CHOICE. THIS IS GENOCIDE.
Rights are irrelevant when the government lies about data to mislead the public about safety, efficacy & need.
Over 50% of infants have had COVID shots in Alberta. 
In less than 2 weeks, Albertans took 307,984 KP.2 COVID shots = 36% of all XBB shots given in the previous year.

Death by design.
Deadly lockdowns never ended. They became extended and more restrictive 'outbreaks' - targeting those most in need of protection. Hospitals, Long Term Care Homes, and Supportive Living (Retirement Homes) - none are 'safe' and it is all under the lie of 'Focused Protection' cheered on by almost all in the freedom movement.
Rights are irrelevant when the government directs hospitals & care homes to increase deadly restrictions for ANY illness. 
COVID isn't treated like flu. Everything from a cold to diarrhea has a 'COVID' response. 303 lockdowns behind closed doors in Alberta since Aug 24, 2024.

• The H5N1 bird flu virus has been identified in a pig in the United States for the first time, marking a significant development in the ongoing bird flu outbreak.
 
• This detection highlights the potential for the virus to spread beyond birds and into other mammals, raising concerns about the public health risk, although the CDC currently assesses this risk as low.

• The CDC is closely monitoring the situation and working with states to track individuals with animal exposures, emphasizing the importance of surveillance and protective measures to prevent further spread.

5411,"It is an established and acknowledged fact that the shots made most people ill soon after they took them. The clinical trials show this. At least 80% of people in the Moderna clinical trial experienced one or more of these symptoms: headache, fever, chills, joint pain, nausea/vomiting, muscle pain. I bet the vast majority of people know at least one person who became quite ill after the vaccine for 3 or more days.

Most people were willing to accept some illness only because they believed the so-called vaccines would prevent them from getting covid and because they were told that illness meant the shots were working. Of course, when the shots failed, the calculus changed. Why suffer through a post-vaccine illness only to then become sick with the virus anyway?  It's common sense not to do this.

I am very curious about why people are still taking boosters, so I often read the comments on New York Times articles about covid boosters. My impression is that people who are still taking the boosters generally fall into two camps. One group has not had post-vaccine illness. They are lucky and also in the minority. The other group is people who are still taking boosters even though past shots have made them sick because they are afraid of covid and/or are following doctor's advice. This group makes me so sad. What a terrible thing to live in this state of fear and cycle of self-harm!

Personally, if I took a pharmaceutical and suffered through illness after because I was led to believe that it would protect me from a virus and then it didn't even work, I'D BE PISSED!

is not just a tasty naturla treat, it also is anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial! Heres a few things honeysuckle can achieve...

-Treating Infections: Honeysuckle is often used to help treat respiratory infections like colds, flu, and sore throats due to its ability to fight bacteria and viruses.
-Reducing Inflammation: It's used to reduce swelling and heat in the body, which can help with conditions like fever or skin inflammations.
-Detoxification: In TCM, honeysuckle is considered to have detoxifying properties, helping to clear heat and toxins from the body, which is believed to aid in the treatment of boils, sores, and other skin conditions.

5694,"🚨 H5N1 avian flu isolate from dairy worker is transmissible, lethal in animals

https://t.co/owowQHJPEq

October 28, 2024
In experiments designed to learn more about the threat from the H5N1 avian flu virus spreading from cows to people, researchers found that an isolate from a sick dairy worker may be capable of replicating in human airway cells, is pathogenic in mice and ferrets, and can transmit among ferrets by respiratory droplets.

The team, based at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Japan, reported its findings today in Nature. Working in a high-containment lab, the researchers used an H5N1 isolate grown from the eye of a dairy worker who had experienced conjunctivitis after exposure to infected cows.

They found that the virus has a PB2-E627K mutation that has been seen in H5N1 viruses that replicate in mammals.

In their multipart investigation, they found that the virus was sensitive to most antivirals, including favipiravir, baloxavir marboxil, and zanamivir, but was less sensitive to oseltamivir, according to a press release from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which funded much of the work.

Tests using human cornea and lung cells found that the virus was able to replicate. And, in mouse tissue experiments, the scientists found that the H5N1 virus was able to infect 15 different tissues, with the highest levels seen in respiratory tissues.

Lethal pattern in ferrets
Meanwhile, the team infected ferrets with a high dose of the virus from the dairy worker, and the infection pattern was more similar to human infections than mice infections. Ferrets are known as one of the best animal models for influenza in humans, because clinical signs of disease and transmission are similar.

All ferrets died within 5 days, and tissue sampling found the virus in all types, with the highest levels in the animals' respiratory tissues. In contrast, earlier research using a bovine H5N1 virus to infect ferrets found that the infections were severe, but not as lethal.

To gauge respiratory transmission, the team placed healthy ferrets in cages next to ferrets that were infected with different doses of the virus from the dairy worker. From 17% to 33% of ferrets in adjacent cages were infected by respiratory droplets, suggesting that the virus from humans can spread among mammals by that route, but with limited efficiency. All directly infected ferrets died within 6 days.

""Based in these observations, every effort should be made to contain HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle to limit the possibility of further human infections,"" they wrote.

California reports another suspected case

California today reported another suspected human H5N1 infection, which if confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would raise the state's total 16.

The CDC on October 25 confirmed 3 more infections in Washington poultry cullers, bringing the national total to 34. Once the California infection is confirmed by the CDC, the national total would rise to 35.

Virus strikes more cows, poultry
Meanwhile, the surge in outbreaks continues in California dairy cattle. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 41 more outbreaks, raising the state's total to 178 and the national total to 380 from 14 states.

Also, APHIS confirmed more outbreaks in poultry in the West, this time in Oregon, including an egg-laying farm in Clackamas County that has 146,000 birds and a backyard facility in Crook County.

The agency also confirmed an outbreak at another broiler farm in Tulare County, California, and another in backyard poultry in Washington.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1851174728473403691,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,1,0,0,0,54,0,2024-10-29 01:10:23,,,combined_dataset.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

5902,"Here are some natural remedies for common ailments that can provide relief while supporting overall well-being:

1. Cold and Flu

•Honey and Lemon: Mix honey with warm water and lemon juice to soothe sore throats and ease coughs. Honey has antimicrobial properties, while lemon provides a boost of vitamin C.
•Ginger Tea: Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can help alleviate congestion and sore throats. Add fresh ginger to hot water with a bit of honey.

2. Headaches

•Peppermint Oil: Applying diluted peppermint oil to the temples can provide relief due to its cooling effect, which may ease tension.
•Lavender Oil: Inhaling lavender oil or using it in a diffuser can help reduce stress and may alleviate headache symptoms.

3. Digestive Issues

•Ginger: Chewing a piece of ginger or drinking ginger tea can relieve nausea and stomach upset.
•Peppermint: Peppermint tea or oil can help soothe digestive discomfort, including bloating and gas.

4. Insomnia

•Chamomile Tea: Known for its calming effects, chamomile tea before bed can help promote relaxation and better sleep.
•Lavender Essential Oil: A few drops on your pillow or in a diffuser can create a calming atmosphere conducive to sleep.

5. Muscle Pain

•Epsom Salt Bath: Adding Epsom salt to a warm bath can help relax muscles and reduce inflammation due to its magnesium content.
•Turmeric: Turmeric’s anti-inflammatory properties make it beneficial for muscle soreness. Drinking golden milk (turmeric with warm milk) may aid in muscle recovery.

6. Stress and Anxiety

•Ashwagandha: This adaptogenic herb is known to help reduce stress by balancing cortisol levels. Ashwagandha supplements or tea can be calming.
•Deep Breathing and Meditation: Practicing mindful breathing exercises can help calm the mind and reduce anxiety naturally.

7. Skin Irritations

•Aloe Vera: Applying fresh aloe vera gel can soothe sunburns and other skin irritations due to its cooling and anti-inflammatory properties.
•Oatmeal Bath: Colloidal oatmeal in a warm bath can help relieve itchy skin caused by eczema or other irritants.

8. Allergies

•Local Honey: Consuming small amounts of local honey is thought to help the body build immunity to local pollen, which may reduce allergy symptoms over time.
•Nasal Rinse with Saline: A saline solution can help clear allergens from nasal passages and reduce congestion.

Using these remedies mindfully can support overall health and alleviate mild symptoms.

So that article was already being very disingenuous as a mild case of covid is the same as a mild case of the flu and a severe case of the flu, if not treated is equally as deadly as COVID. 

The only argument you might have had was prior to vaccines being a thing, and even then, natural immunity would have taken effect had we made sure to protect those most vulnerable to the disease, let us say, people 70 or older and people who are immuno-compromised.

I KNEW everything about COVID was a HOAX. I saw the lies, the ""dancing nurses"", the suppression of medicine, and the stories about intubation doing much more harm than good. The 99.8% survivability. I even said that they wanted to kill us, it's depopulation and understood it in a movie-like sense.

Yet, I didn't understand that they were REALLY killing people, and even MY local medical personnel were going along with it. I mean, there were no carts of dead people. I didn't see multiple funeral processions. No spike in obits in the newspaper (not that I looked at newspapers too often).

I don't think I really believed any of it. Until they killed my husband. I don't even know if I'm making sense here. Because I didn't think any of it was REALLY, REALLY real, I blame myself for allowing them to kill him.

6208,"OHA reports 3 humans with bird flu traveled to Oregon during Washington outbreak

https://t.co/aZ1kI8w6II

A week after Washington reported human cases of bird flu in the state, officials have announced that three of those cases had traveled to Oregon during their infection and were monitored during their stay.

All three cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were reported in Washington after they were exposed to poultry that tested positive for the virus on Oct. 15. As of Thursday, Oct. 31, there have been nine total cases in Washington — including those who had traveled to Oregon.

Oregon Health Authority officials say the cases have returned to Washington and will continue to be monitored by Washington health staff until 10 days following their last exposure.

“At this time, the risk for the general public remains low,” Dr. Melissa Sutton with Oregon Public Health said in a statement. “People who have had close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals, or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at increased risk of infection.”

Washington Department of Health announced another bird flu case that led to 800,000 euthanized birds in Franklin County after they all tested positive on Oct. 15. Another case was recorded at a Clackamas County commercial poultry farm, and those birds were also euthanized to limit the spread of the disease.

It is not clear which Clackamas County poultry facility was impacted in this case, but the ODA said the operation consisted of 150,000 birds.

So far, there have been no human cases of HPAI that originated in Oregon.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1852294891801313335,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,0,0,0,0,-,0,2024-11-01 03:21:30,,,combined_dataset.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

The ER is only for life or limb threatening issues like sudden chest pain, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, trauma, compound fractures, severe abdominal pain, or the worst headache of your life, etc. 

Urgent Care is for colds/flu (although staying home is even better), rashes with a fever (over 101), breaks/sprains, uncontrolled vomiting/diarrhea, UTIs, stitches, vaginal bleeding, minor car accidents, etc. Things you can’t wait a week to be addressed but won’t kill you right now. 

Your PCP is for back pain, chronic issues, pregnancy tests, prescription refills, ingrown toenails, abscesses, rashes, STDs, vaginal discharge, chronic cough, disability, diagnosing symptoms, etc. 

The ER is not for work notes, pregnancy tests, tooth pain, hangovers, fevers under 103, or medication refills. 

Calling an ambulance will not get you seen any faster in the ER  nor will complaining about the wait. If you’re well enough to complain, you probably shouldn’t be in an ER. 

Don’t be THAT patient that makes us roll our eyes and clogs up the ER. 

Hopefully this helps direct you to the right place to get your care.",https://x.com/CaliRN619/status/1845990625612599490,tweet,CaliRN619 🚑🩺🚑,@CaliRN619,,,,42,1,191,201,13944,25,2024-10-14 17:50:36,https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1845990541193793536/img/1r95Q2gmR91JnA2-.jpg,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1845990541193793536/vid/avc1/720x916/PqiRtjfvyWR8RNne.mp4?tag=16,combined_dataset.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

6511,"It is an established and acknowledged fact that the shots made most people ill soon after they took them. The clinical trials show this. At least 80% of people in the Moderna clinical trial experienced one or more of these symptoms: headache, fever, chills, joint pain, nausea/vomiting, muscle pain. I bet the vast majority of people know at least one person who became quite ill after the vaccine for 3 or more days.

Most people were willing to accept some illness only because they believed the so-called vaccines would prevent them from getting covid and because they were told that illness meant the shots were working. Of course, when the shots failed, the calculus changed. Why suffer through a post-vaccine illness only to then become sick with the virus anyway?  It's common sense not to do this.

I am very curious about why people are still taking boosters, so I often read the comments on New York Times articles about covid boosters. My impression is that people who are still taking the boosters generally fall into two camps. One group has not had post-vaccine illness. They are lucky and also in the minority. The other group is people who are still taking boosters even though past shots have made them sick because they are afraid of covid and/or are following doctor's advice. This group makes me so sad. What a terrible thing to live in this state of fear and cycle of self-harm!

Personally, if I took a pharmaceutical and suffered through illness after because I was led to believe that it would protect me from a virus and then it didn't even work, I'D BE PISSED!

https://t.co/aZ1kI8w6II

A week after Washington reported human cases of bird flu in the state, officials have announced that three of those cases had traveled to Oregon during their infection and were monitored during their stay.

All three cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were reported in Washington after they were exposed to poultry that tested positive for the virus on Oct. 15. As of Thursday, Oct. 31, there have been nine total cases in Washington — including those who had traveled to Oregon.

Oregon Health Authority officials say the cases have returned to Washington and will continue to be monitored by Washington health staff until 10 days following their last exposure.

“At this time, the risk for the general public remains low,” Dr. Melissa Sutton with Oregon Public Health said in a statement. “People who have had close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals, or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at increased risk of infection.”

Washington Department of Health announced another bird flu case that led to 800,000 euthanized birds in Franklin County after they all tested positive on Oct. 15. Another case was recorded at a Clackamas County commercial poultry farm, and those birds were also euthanized to limit the spread of the disease.

It is not clear which Clackamas County poultry facility was impacted in this case, but the ODA said the operation consisted of 150,000 birds.

So far, there have been no human cases of HPAI that originated in Oregon.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1852294891801313335,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,0,0,0,0,5,0,2024-11-01 03:21:30,,,combined_dataset.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

6910,"🚨Alberta COVID Update Oct 31, 2024
COVID Deaths
4 reported - 22 added, 119 total.
Only 1 Flu, 0 RSV all season.

KP.2 shots
161,881 given (314,488 total).

'Outbreaks'
45 new outbreaks (~200 active).

89.3% of all COVID shots given by Pharmacies under direct contract to the Alberta Government - FOR PROFIT

91% of all 'outbreaks' in the last week were listed as 'COVID' based on known flawed RPP and RAT tests.
Each 'positive' test isolates a resident/patient for 5 days (Care Home)/10 days (Hospital) AND extends isolation protocols for the whole unit/floor for an additional 15 days.

Patients/Residents are also being moved post-isolation into rooms with other 'positive' residents/patients and flagged as 'Close Contacts'. They are then placed again on COVID isolation protocols for a further 10 days.
TESTED AND ISOLATED TO DEATH.

The AGM vote won't change anything.
All the people who are really 'CHOOSING"" your UCP leader this weekend support the perception of ""CHOICE"". Just not your expectation of choice.
There is no Informed Consent while the government lies and those around them help with the cover-up.
This isn't CHOICE. THIS IS GENOCIDE.
Rights are irrelevant when the government lies about data to mislead the public about safety, efficacy & need.
Over 50% of infants have had COVID shots in Alberta. 
In less than 2 weeks, Albertans took 307,984 KP.2 COVID shots = 36% of all XBB shots given in the previous year.

Death by design.
Deadly lockdowns never ended. They became extended and more restrictive 'outbreaks' - targeting those most in need of protection. Hospitals, Long Term Care Homes, and Supportive Living (Retirement Homes) - none are 'safe' and it is all under the lie of 'Focused Protection' cheered on by almost all in the freedom movement.
Rights are irrelevant when the government directs hospitals & care homes to increase deadly restrictions for ANY illness. 
COVID isn't treated like flu. Everything from a cold to diarrhea has a 'COVID' response. 303 lockdowns behind closed doors in Alberta since Aug 24, 2024.

If you vote at the UCP AGM, remember no one pushing politics as an answer plans for the insanity to end. Cash cow lawsuits, designed to fail. Legislation that makes things worse (Sovereignty Act, Bill of Rights). None want accountability, because they are also accountable.

https://t.co/aZ1kI8w6II

A week after Washington reported human cases of bird flu in the state, officials have announced that three of those cases had traveled to Oregon during their infection and were monitored during their stay.

All three cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were reported in Washington after they were exposed to poultry that tested positive for the virus on Oct. 15. As of Thursday, Oct. 31, there have been nine total cases in Washington — including those who had traveled to Oregon.

Oregon Health Authority officials say the cases have returned to Washington and will continue to be monitored by Washington health staff until 10 days following their last exposure.

“At this time, the risk for the general public remains low,” Dr. Melissa Sutton with Oregon Public Health said in a statement. “People who have had close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals, or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at increased risk of infection.”

Washington Department of Health announced another bird flu case that led to 800,000 euthanized birds in Franklin County after they all tested positive on Oct. 15. Another case was recorded at a Clackamas County commercial poultry farm, and those birds were also euthanized to limit the spread of the disease.

It is not clear which Clackamas County poultry facility was impacted in this case, but the ODA said the operation consisted of 150,000 birds.

So far, there have been no human cases of HPAI that originated in Oregon.",https://x.com/Deborah07849071/status/1852294891801313335,tweet,Deborah,@Deborah07849071,EARTH,,,0,0,0,0,5,0,2024-11-01 03:21:30,,,TwiBot-undefined-20241101_033721.csv,2024-11-01 16:35:38.823617

COVID Deaths
4 reported - 22 added, 119 total.
Only 1 Flu, 0 RSV all season.

KP.2 shots
161,881 given (314,488 total).

'Outbreaks'
45 new outbreaks (~200 active).

89.3% of all COVID shots given by Pharmacies under direct contract to the Alberta Government - FOR PROFIT

91% of all 'outbreaks' in the last week were listed as 'COVID' based on known flawed RPP and RAT tests.
Each 'positive' test isolates a resident/patient for 5 days (Care Home)/10 days (Hospital) AND extends isolation protocols for the whole unit/floor for an additional 15 days.

Patients/Residents are also being moved post-isolation into rooms with other 'positive' residents/patients and flagged as 'Close Contacts'. They are then placed again on COVID isolation protocols for a further 10 days.
TESTED AND ISOLATED TO DEATH.

The AGM vote won't change anything.
All the people who are really 'CHOOSING"" your UCP leader this weekend support the perception of ""CHOICE"". Just not your expectation of choice.
There is no Informed Consent while the government lies and those around them help with the cover-up.
This isn't CHOICE. THIS IS GENOCIDE.
Rights are irrelevant when the government lies about data to mislead the public about safety, efficacy & need.
Over 50% of infants have had COVID shots in Alberta. 
In less than 2 weeks, Albertans took 307,984 KP.2 COVID shots = 36% of all XBB shots given in the previous year.

Death by design.
Deadly lockdowns never ended. They became extended and more restrictive 'outbreaks' - targeting those most in need of protection. Hospitals, Long Term Care Homes, and Supportive Living (Retirement Homes) - none are 'safe' and it is all under the lie of 'Focused Protection' cheered on by almost all in the freedom movement.
Rights are irrelevant when the government directs hospitals & care homes to increase deadly restrictions for ANY illness. 
COVID isn't treated like flu. Everything from a cold to diarrhea has a 'COVID' response. 303 lockdowns behind closed doors in Alberta since Aug 24, 2024.
