    "The project develops an AI-driven detection system for tracking influenza, an acute viral infection causing annual epidemics with severe respiratory symptoms, and tuberculosis, a bacterial infection that remains a major public health threat especially in developing nations. Using social media data, the system aims to identify outbreaks early, enabling faster response from WHO and health agencies to reduce disease spread and mortality. CopyRetry"

    "Early detection of influenza and tuberculosis outbreaks is critical, but official reporting often lags behind the initial spread. Social media data could provide an early warning system, but requires AI-powered analysis to identify and track disease trends before they become full-blown epidemics."

    "3. Identify high-risk areas for outbreaks before they are officially reported.\n",

    "1. Collect real-time social media data (from platforms like Twitter, Reddit) using APIs and keyword-based filtering.\n",
    "2. Apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect mentions of disease symptoms, concerns, and outbreak-related keywords.\n",
    "3. Conduct sentiment analysis to identify posts indicating fear, panic or growing anxiety around potential outbreaks.\n",
    "4. Leverage machine learning models like SVMs and neural networks to classify social posts as related to disease outbreaks or not.\n",
    "5. Utilize anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual spikes in outbreak-related keywords and phrases.\n",
    "6. Map the geospatial and temporal data to visualize disease spread patterns and high-risk clusters.\n",
    "7. Validate social media-derived insights against official health reports to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "8. Develop predictive models to forecast outbreak trajectories and build an automated alert system for public health authorities."
